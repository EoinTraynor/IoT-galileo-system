# IoT Galileo System

This project required a group of two students to implement a two sided system that communicates via a network connection as sender/receiver using two microcontrollers. The task also encouraged the use of sending or receiving data from the cloud, classifying it as an IoT (Internet of Things) solution.
The system developed focused on the concept of identifying and reducing the energy consumption of buildings. One of the microcontrollers would read various important environment variables e.g. temperature and send this information to the second microcontroller which, using the data, would control different components e.g. a fan. The system also integrated the use of an external weather API, allowing the application to collect further data.
